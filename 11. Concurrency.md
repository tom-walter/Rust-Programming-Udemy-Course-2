## 11. Concurrency

### 11.1 Overview
* concurrency is often considered a very advanced topic in programming
* concurrency means multiple processes or threads run at the same time (potentially working with shared data)
* but rust memory safety features aim to make parallelization easier
* 3 aspects of concurrency
  * Threads: üß∂
  * Channels: üì¨
  * Mutex: üîê

### 11.2 Threads
__What are Threads?__
* they allow us to run code in parallel
* ownership/borrowing mechanisms also works across threads
  * provides memory safety
  * no data races (because of single ownership)
* creating a thread
  ```rust
  use std::thread;
  ...
  let th = thread::spawn(closure)
  ```
* joining threads
  * if the main thread finishes before the other threads, the program exits
  * join the other threads into the main one to finish all threads before exit
  ```rust
  th.join()
  ```

### 11.3 Channels
__What are channels?__
* channels are a tool to send data between threads
* there is the _MPSC_ - multiple producer single receiver
  * with this channel many sources can send data to one thread
* channels have two endpoints: the `Sender<T>` and the `Receiver<T>`,
  * where `T` is the type of the message to be transferred
  * in rust, they are called the transmitter `tx` and the receiver `rx`
* create a channel; send & receive data
  ```rust
  use std::sync::mpsc;
  ...
  let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
  ...
  tx.send();
  ...
  rx.recv()     // blocking
  rx.try_recv() // non-blocking
  ```
Example 1:
* send data from one sub-thread to the main-thread
  ```rust
  let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
  thread::spawn(move || {tx.send(42).unwrap()});
  println!("received {}", rx.recv().unwrap());
  ```

### 11.4 Mutex
__What's a Mutex?__
* mutex is short for _mutual exclusion lock_
* only one thread can access the data at any one time
* this prevents data races and similar data access troubles
* once the data gets released by the lock, a new thread can lock onto it
* rust provides `Arc` _atomically referenced counted_ type
  * which converts data into primitive types and makes them save fo share across threads
* create a lock
  ```rust
  use std::sync::{Mutex, Arc};
  ...
  let lock = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
  ...
  lock.lock() // acquire ownership
  ```
* additional lock methods
  ```rust
  lock.try_lock();
  ```
  * will try to unlock a mutex, if this is not possible, it continue execution
  * whereas the `lock()` method, will wait until the mutex is unlocked
  ```rust
  lock.is_poisoned();
  ```
  * if a sub-thread panics, then the main-thread won't panic
* this helps so that threads do not access the data at the same time
* code example under `/11-concurrency/mutex.rs`
