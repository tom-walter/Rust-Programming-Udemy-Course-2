## 4. Modules

### 4.1 Overview
* this section is about modules and crates
* they help create our own software for sharing with others and use code that other have created
* Rust crates are hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io/)

### 4.2 Modules

__Creating a Module__
* let's create our own module, meaning we write code in one Rust script that we want to use in another Rust script 
* create a new script called `player.rs` and write the following code
  ```Rust
  pub fn play_movie(name: &str){
    println!("Playing movie: {}", name);
  }

  pub fn play_audio(name: &str){
    println!("Playing audio: {}", name);
  }
  ```
* the keyword `pub` ensures that function is visible outside its original file

__Calling a Module__
* next import the module `player.rs` by writing `mod player;` at the top of next script
* use the included functions by calling them like this 
  ```Rust
  player::play_movie("your_movie.mp4");
  player::play_audio("your_audio.mp3");
  ```
* the code for this exercise is under `./04-modules/module`

__Formalizing a Module__

* the functions of your module should not live unorganized in their script
* using the keyword `mod`, they can be grouped
* the basic structure will look like this
  ```Rust
  pub mod module_name {
    pub fn do_something_a(){
        ...
    }
    pub fn do_something_b(){
        ...
    }
  }
  ```
* this can help maintain a better overview and separation of responsibilites

### 4.3 Crates
* crates are an abstraction of top of modules
* multiple modules are grouped into a crate
* there are 2 types:
  1. binary crates  ðŸ“¦ðŸ”¡
  2. library crates ðŸ“¦ðŸ“š
* a binary crates has an entry point
  * this entry point is the `main` function
  * it will be run when the compiled, binary crate is executed
* a library crate has no entry point
  * simply provides functionalities for others
* external crates can managed with `Cargo`
  * add them to the `Cargo.toml` under the `[dependencies]` section with the specific version
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.7.3"
    ```
  * then run `cargo build` inside the project
* crates are imported with the keyword `use` or `use crate::{mod}::{function}`
  * these imports can also be aliased with the keyword `as`
