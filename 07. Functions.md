## 7. Functions

### 7.1 Overview
* we've already discussed functions, but here we will do more in-depth learning
* functions and scopes are fundamental in how Rust deals with variables
* closures (also called lambdas in other programming languages) are anonymous function
* higher-order functions take another function or closure as parameter
* macros are meta-programming or code that writes code

### 7.2 Functions and Scope
__How are Functions created?__
* function signature
  * the keyword `fn` starts a function signature
  * then the function name follows
  * parenthesis `()` contain the arguments / paramters of a function
    * `mut` variables must be de-referenced inside the function 
  * the output is typed with `->`
  * curly braces `{}` contain the body of the function (i.e. the scope)
  * the keyword `return` is optional in Rust

__Scope__
* Rust is about memory safety
  * no garbage collector
  * no memory-leaks
  * no need to manually de-allocate variables
* in Rust, curly braaces `{}` create a scope
* all variables are de-allocated once they "go out of scope"
  ```Rust
  {
    let a: u16 = 3;
  }
  println!("{}", a); // will cause error
  ```
* global variables will not go out of scope (for the entirety of the programm) and are considered __unsafe__ in Rust
  * they are declared as `unsafe`
  * Rust cannot guarantee memory safety on `unsafe` variables
    ```Rust
    static mut B i32 = 0;
    fn main()
    {
        unsafe { println!("{}", B); }
    }
    ```

### 7.3 Closure
* closures are functions within a function
* they are anonymous functions somethimes called lambda functions
  ```Rust
  |a: i32, b: i32| println!("{}", a + b);
  |a: i32, b: i32| -> i32 {a + b};
  ```
* a closure can be assigned to a variable
  ```Rust
  let sum = |a: i32, b: i32| -> i32 {a + b};
  sum(2, 3)
  ```
* a closure can be be generic (without specific type-annotation)
  ```Rust
  let gen = |x| {println!("received {}", x)};
  gen("hello");
  ```
  * but once called a specific type will always be expected in the generic close

### 7.4 Higher Order Functions

__Short Explainer__
* higher-order functions take another function as paramter
  ```Rust
  fn apply(f: fn(i32)->i32, a: i32){...}
  //
  apply(|x| -> x + 1, a);
  ```
* there are a set higher order functions ready to use in Rust

__Exercise__
* in the last section, we build a function that sums the suqares until a limit was reached
  * optionally, only for even numbers
* rebuild this functionality using higher order functions

### 7.5 Macros

* macros are functions ending with an exclamation mark 'macro!()'
* meta-programming: code that writes more code
  * they are a short-hand invocation
  * it matches an expression & performs operation
  * code is expanded and compiled
* we have already seen the following macros
  * `println!` & `format!` & `vec!`
* we can define our own with the `macro_rules!` keyword
  ```Rust
  macro_rules! my_macro {
    (match1) => {code to run}
    (match2) => {code to run}
  }
  ```
* macros may receive parameters
  * can be zero, one or more, but generally the exact number cannot be known beforehand (like a vector)
* simplified example for `vec!`
  ```Rust
  macro_rules! my_vec {
    ( $( $x: expr ) , * ) => {
        {
            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            $(
                temp_vec.push($x);
            )*
            temp_vec
        }
    };
  ```
  * body is similar to the structure of a match statement
  * left-side holds a pattern & right-side holds code associated with the pattern (when matched, the code is executed)
  * `$` decalted a macro variable (not a regular variable)
  * `$x:expr` matches any Rust expression
  * the nesting `( $( $x: expr ) , * )` with the `*` specifies that the pattern matches zero or more of whatever precedes
* with `ident` designator, macros can be used to build functions
  ```Rust
  macro_rules! build_fn {
    ($fn_name: ident) => {
        fn $fn_name(){}
            println!("{:?} was called", stringify!($fn_name));
    }
  }
  //   
  build_fn!(hello);
  hello();
  ```
