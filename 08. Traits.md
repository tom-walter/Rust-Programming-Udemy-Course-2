## 8. Traits

### 8.1 Overview
* traits are similar to interfaces in other languages
* basically, they are there to expand functionality of structs in generic or specific ways
* this section will discuss
  * what are traits
  * generics
  * dynamic types
  * operator overloading
  * static dispatch
  * dynamic dispatch

### 8.2 Traits

__What are traits?__
* traits are similar to an interface or abstract class
* instead of being build inside the struct, they are created separately allowing for more flexibility
* traits can implement functionalities for structs
* add definitions (signatures) without explicit implementation
  ```Rust
  trait Name {
    fn must_implement(&self) -> i32;
    fn do_action(&self) {...}
    fn do_non_instance() {...}
  }
  ```
* they can have definitions only or default implementations
* they can habe instance and non-instance actions 

__Coding a Trait__

* first create a `struct`:
  ```Rust
  struct Person {
      name: String,
  }
  ```
* create a trait with the `impl` keyword:
  ```Rust
  impl Name for Person {
      fn must_implement(&self) -> {42}
  }
  ```
* can provide a constructor
  ```Rust
  impl Name {
      fn new(name: &str) -> Self;
  }
  ```

### 8.3 Trait Generics
__Why and how to use trait generics__
* generics can be used with traits
* generics limit the types of variables passed to a function or struct
* generics can be shaped by traits
* e.g. generics can be limited by traits
  ```Rust
  fn color<T: Colorable> (a: T){
    ...
  }
  ```
__Example__
* see code in `/08-traits/traits_generics.rs`

### 8.4 Returning Traits
__How to return traits__ 
* traits cannot be returned just by themselves
* this is because of memory safety
* Rust compiler needs to know the size of a returned value before it is actually returned
* a workaround is providing a `Box` object in combination with a `dyn` trait
  ```Rust
  fn get_anmial() -> Box<dyn Animal> {
    ...
  }
  ```
* this allows the trait to be dynamically compiled

__Example__
* see code in `/08-traits/traits_return.rs`

### 8.5 Adding Traits to Structs

__How to add a `trait` to any `struct`__
* traits can be added to any struct, even the once we didn't create ourselves
* the signature for implementation is simple
  ```Rust
  impl My_Trait<T> for My_Struct<T> {
    ...
  }
  ```

__Example__
* you can a trait that sums the elements of Rust vector
  ```Rust
  trait Summable<T> {
      fn sum(&self) -> T;
  }

  impl Summable<i32> for Vec<i32> {
      fn sum(&self) -> i32 {
          let mut sum: i32 = 0;
          for n in self {
              sum += *n;
          }
          return sum
      }
  }
  ```
* this implementation is specific for the data type `i32`
* for a generic implementatio use `<T>`

### 8.6 Operator Overloading

* we can also add existing operators (traits) to our structs
  * it is called operator overloading
* this saves us from having to write multiple implementations
* the steps are
  ```Rust
  use std::ops::Add;

  struct Customg {...}

  impl Add for Custom {
    type Output = Custom;
    fn add(&self, other: Self) -> Self::Output{
      ...
    }
  }
  ```  
* a list of Rust operators is available in the [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/ops/)

### 8.7 Static Dispatch

__Introduction__
* there are two ways of passing argument to a function and converting structures into their specific traits in order to apply the functionality
* these two ways help the compiler know what to call and how
  * 1 __static__: pre-determined
  * 2 __dynamic__: determined at run-time

__Static Dispatch__
* a generic trait will be converted to the required type at _compile time_
* the compiler will write several version of a functions that takes a generic trait
  * one for each implementation of the trait that is needed to run the code
  * pre-condition is that the trait written for each data type
* this is also called monomorphization
  * meaning a generic form is converted into one specific form

__Example__
* see code in `/08-traits/traits_static_dispatch.rs`

### 8.8 Dynamic Dispatch
__Dynamic Dispatch__
* a generic trait will be converted to the required type at _run-time_
* dynamic dispatch uses not a generic type but rather a reference
* thus, the function call must be to referenced dynamic variables
  * `&` reference and `dyn` dynamic
* the function will look for the specific implementation
* it cannot be inferred at compile-time (because variables are not yet created)

__Example__
* see code in `/08-traits/traits_dynamic_dispatch.rs`
