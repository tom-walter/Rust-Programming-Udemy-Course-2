## 2. Setup Basics

### 2.1 Overview

* in this section of the course, we will
  * install Rust and setzp the Hello World project
  * learn about the Cargo package manager
  * handle user input
  * write code comments
  * print values to the console
* all the code created with this section is located in the folder `/02-hello-world`

### 2.5 Installation

Quick Guide
* download the installer from the official  [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
* create a new Rust file using the `.rs` file ending
* create a new Rust project using the command `cargo new <my_project>`
* the `Cargo.toml` is a configuration file for collecting dependencies and compiling your code

Exercise 
* without creating a new project, create new `hello_world.rs` file
* paste the following code
```Rust
fn main(){
    println!("Hello world! üåê");
    println!("I'm a Rustacean. ü¶Ä")
}
```
* compile with the command `rustc main.rs`
* the code lies here: `/02-hello-world/hello_world.rs`

Congratuluations to your first Rust program!

### 2.6. Package Manager

* __Cargo__ is Rust's package manager with many standard functions to help you setup, manage, and deploy your projects
* here is an overview of the basic Cargo commands
  * `cargo new <my_project>` = create a Rust project with folder structure and versio control
  * `cargo build` = compile the current package
  * `cargo run` = run the main code of your current project
  * `cargo clean` = clean up everything except the source code 
  * `cargo install <crate>` = installs an external Rust package to your project
* for all Cargo commands, see the [official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/index.html)

### 2.7 User Input

Why learn about this?
* how do we get user input in Rust?
* Rust is generally not intended for interacting with users, but for building backend stuff
* nonetheless, obtaining user input is helpful with many beginner's example


Let's build a small app
* import the standard library for input-output handling `std::io`
* create an empty `String` to store the user's input
* read the input with `io::stdin().read_line()`
* build a 2-case match-statement, testing for valid or invalid inputs
  * Ok: print the valid input
  * Error: print the error message
* the code lies here: `/02-hello-world/user_input.rs`

### 2.8 Comments
What are comments?
* comments are lines of text in the code that are not compiled by the compiler
* they can serve as prosaic description of what your code does (to your future self or other programmers)
* professional projects require documentation following certain guidelines
* therefore, Rust differentiates between simple comments and documentation comments
* line comment:
    ```rust 
    // this is a line comment
    ```
* mutli-line comment:
    ```rust 
    /* this is a line comment */
    ```
* crate-level documentation:
    ```rust 
    /// this is crate documentation
    ```
* function-level documentation:
    ```rust 
    //! this is function documentation
    ```
* doc-comments
  * will allow markdown formatting for better legibility
  * code examples must be valid code!

### 2.9 Printing Values

The **`println!`** Macro
* we have already looked at printing String values to the console using the marco `println!`
* here are some functionalities of this macro
* simple printing
  ```rust
  println!("Hello world! üåê");
  ```
* formatting with curly braces `{}`
  ```rust
  println!("Hello, my name is {} and I'm {} years old.", "Tom", 28);
  ```
* evaluating expressions `a + b`
  ```rust
  println!("3 + 6 = {}", 9);
  ```
* positional arguments `{0}`
  ```rust
  println!("{0} has a {2} and {0} has a {1}", "Tom", "cat", "dog");
  ```
* named arguments `{:name}`
  ```rust
  println!("{first} {last}, {book}", first="Adam", last="Smith", book="Wealth of Nations");
  ```
* printing traits
  * numbers can be converted before printing, making use of their underlying traits
  ```rust
  println!("binary: {:b}, Hex: {:x}, Octal: {:o}", 5, 5, 5);
  ```
* printing collections `{:?}`
  * collection can be printed to console using their debug trait and the `{:?}`-format
  ```rust
  println!("array = {:?}", [0, 1, 2, 3]);
  ```
* the code lies here: `/02-hello-world/printing_values.rs`
