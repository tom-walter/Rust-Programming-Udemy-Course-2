__Caveats__
* there limitations & differences to regular blockchain implementations and this one
* there will be
  * no distributed hosting (ledger)
  * no distributed computing
  * no special security features
  * nothing will be saved to file 

__Functionality__
* create blocks and chain them
* generate a genesis block
* run transactions on the blockchain
* generate new blocks
* adjust difficulty
* adjust reward
