## 6. Control Flow

### 6.1 Overview
* control flow statements influence what lines of code will be executed under certain conditions or how often they will be executed
* among other things, Rust has a very powerful pattern matching ability that will also be discussed in this section 

### 6.2 If-Else Statement
* the `if` statement performs one branch of code when a condition evaluates to `true` and another branch of code when the condition is `false`
  * the `false` branch is optional
  ```Rust
  if logical_expression {
    do_one_thing();
  }
  else {
    do_other_thing();
  }
  ```
* if-else statements can be nested with `else if`
* if-else statements can be used to return values
  ```Rust
  let res = if num >= {true} else {false},
  ```

### 6.3 Match Statement
* the keyword `match` is similar to `when` or `switch` in other languages
  ```Rust
  match expression {
    case1 => {...},
    case1 => {...},
    _ => {...}
  }
  ```
* the cases must be exhaustive otherwise the compiler will to compile
* match cases can return results
* match cases cane be made of ranges

### 6.4 Pattern Matching

* matching is very powerful in Rust
* it can `match` on
  * multiple values `1 | 2`
  * ranges `1..=5`
  * conditions `x if a > b`
  * tuples

__Exercise__
* use the different ways of creating cases for a match statement
* code is at `./06-control-flow/oranges.rs` 

### 6.5 For Loop
* a `for` loop iterates over a collection of elements
* at each round through the loop, the code gets executed again
  ```Rust
  for n in 1..=10 {
    do_something();
  }
  ```
* when the end of the collection or a `break` point is reached, the loop exits
* a `continue` will skip over one iteration

### 6.6 While Loop
* the `while` loop only runs as long as condition evaluates to `true` 
  ```Rust
  while condition {
    do_something();
  }
  ```
* Rust also has the keyword `loop` which works like `while true` and must be explicitly broken to exit the loop
