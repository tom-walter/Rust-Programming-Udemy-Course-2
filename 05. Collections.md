## 5. Collections

### 5.1 Overview
What are Collection data types?
* they are containers that contain several elements of data (of the same or differing types)

### 5.2 Arrays
* arrays are a collection of values of the same type
  ```Rust
  let primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
  let doubles: [f64; 4] = [2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0];
  ```
* they are static in size and cannot be resized
  * elements cannot be added or removed
  * but elements can be updated if the array is mutable
* arrays can be filled with defaults
  ```Rust
  let zeros = [0; 10];
  let threes = [DEFAULT; 5];
  ```
* arrays are zero-indexed
* arrays have built-in iterator method `.iter()`
  ```Rust
  for n in numbers.iter(){
    println!("{}", n);
  }
  ```

### 5.3 Vectors
* vectors are similar to arrays but have variable size
* vectors can be instantiated in several ways
  ```Rust
  let mut primes: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
  // or
  let mut primes = vec![2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
  ```
* vectors are also zero-indexed
* in mutable vectors, elments can be
  * added `vector.push(value)`
  * removed `vector.remove(index)`
  * or updated `vector[index] = values`
* vectors can also be initialized with a default value
* vectors have built-in iterator method `vector.iter()`

### 5.4 Slices

* slices are not as easy to understand, but a very powerful to access data in an array or vector 
  * effectively, it is a pointer to a block of memory
* a slices points a subset of elements of an array or vector
  ```Rust
  let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  let slice = &numbers[1..=3];
  println!("{:?}", slice);
  >> [2, 3, 4]
  ```
* size is determined at run-time
  * e.g. out of bound errors will not be warned at compile time
* can be used on arrays, vectors or strings
* mutable slices of mutables collections can change values

### 5.5 Tuples
* tuples are collections of values of various types
* tuples are static and cannot be resized
* the elements can be updated, if the new value is of the same type
* tuples are zero-indexed
* tuples are limited to 12 elements

```Rust
// creating a tuple
let mut person: (&str, u32, bool) = ("John", 27, true);
// accessing elements
let name = person.0;
// destructering a tuple
let (name, age, employment) = person;
```

### 5.6 Structures

__What are `struct`s?__
* structure `struct` are similar to a (data) class from other languages but not exactly the same
* a `struct` can be created with its own name and attributes
  * attributes can be accessed by their name `my_struct.attribute`
  * since `struct`s are not primitive data types, they cannot be printed per se
  * using the decorator `#[derive(Debug)]`, they can be printed through debug output 
* methods can be added to the `struct` but this is done outside of the definition
  * the keyword `impl` implements methods onto the `struct`  

__Exercise__
* create an employee struct with name, company, and age as attributes
* implement 2 methods for this struct
  * a static method
  * a method that returns a string of the attributes prettified by the `format!` macro


### 5.7 Enums

* enums are an enumeration of values
* they are used to describe selection of fixed states or defaults
* enums are created using the keyword `enum`
  ```Rust
  enum Colors {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
  }
  ``` 
* enums can be typed 
  ```Rust
  enum Person {
    Name(String),
    Surname(String),
    Age(u32),
  }
  ``` 

### 5.8 Generics

* generics are a kind of type-annotation that is generic rather than specific
* if you would like a struct that handles numbers but you don't want to be limited to integer or float only, use generics
* generic type-annotation can be on the `struct`s or `enum`s
  ```Rust
  struct Point<T>{
    x: T,
    y: T,
  }
  ```
  * but when initialized, the values `x` and `y` must have them same generic data type
* to allow for two differing data types, use two generics
  ```Rust
  struct Point<T, V>{
    x: T,
    y: V,
  }
  ```
