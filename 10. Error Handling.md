## 10. Error Handling

### 10.1 Overview
* in this section, we will talk about error handling
* we combine this with another learning goal: file handling in Rust
* working with files is essential in any programming language
* but working with files also leads to easy-to-understand error to learn error handling
  * e.g. opening a file that does not exist
* we will also look into helper methods for error hanlding and the `?` operator for that purpose

### 10.2 Working with Files
* common file operations are: create, open, read, write, append, and delete
* file creation
  ```rust
  use std::fs::File;
  ...
  let mut file = File::create("example.txt").expect("failed");
  ```
  * we do not necessarily expect this function to fail
  * instead, this is a way of error-handling
* writing to a file
  * writing content to a file
  ```rust
  use std::io::Write;
  ...
  file.write_all("hello world\n".as_bytes()).expect("write failed");
  ```
* append to a file
  * instead of overwriting the existing file, we can also append content the file
  ```rust
  use std::fs::OpenOptions;
  ...
  let mut file = OpenOptions::new().append(true).open("example.txt").expect("failed");
  file.write_all("hello world\n".as_bytes()).expect("append failed")
  ```
* reading from a file
  * reading the contents from an existing file
  ```rust
  use std::io::Read;
  ...
  let mut file = File::open("example.txt").unwrap();
  file.read_to_string(&mut contents).unwrap();
  ```
  * `.unwrap()` is another way of getting faciliting success- or error-outcome
* file deletion
  ```rust
  use std::fs::remove_file;
  ...
  remove_file("example.txt").expect("delete failed");
  ```

### 10.3 Error Handling
__What types of errors exists?__
* there are 2 types of error
  * 1 recoverable
    * can still continue the program
    * has a result `enum`
  * 2 unrecoverable
    * crashes the program
    * has a `panic!` macro

__Unrecoverable Errors__
* example for a crashing error
  ```rust
  let v: Vec<i32> = (0..5).collect();
  v[10];
  ```
  ```console
  $ ./errors.exe 
  > thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', errors.rs:3:5
  > note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
  ```
* raising our own crashing error
  * division with divisor of zero is not defined
  ```rust
  let div = |a: f64, b: f64| -> f64 {
        if b == 0.0 {panic!("Zero Division Error")
        else {return a / b}
    };
  let div_result = div(5.0, 0.0)
  ```
  ```console
  $ ./errors.exe 
  > thread 'main' panicked at 'Zero Division Error', errors.rs:10:13
  > note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
  ```
__Recoverable Errors__
* these don't necessarily impact the complete execution of the programm
* they can be handled with the built-in `enum Result`
  ```rust
  enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E)
  }
  ```
* this can be used to build a program that does not immediatly crash upon a recoverable error
  ```rust
  use std::fs::File;
  use std::io::Error;
  ...
  let file: Result<File, Error> = File::open("meme.jpg");
  match file {
      Ok(file) => {println!("File opened: {:?}", file)},
      Err(e) => {println!("File not found: {:?}", e)}
  }
  println!("Continuing program ...") 
  ```
* code examples under `/10-error-mgmt/errors.rs`

### 10.4 Helper Methods
__Helper Method for Error Handling__
* `unwrap` method
  * will return the data, if it's avavailable or ´panic!´ if it's not
  ```rust
  File::open("example.txt").unwrap();
  ```
  * the panic is an unrecoverable error
  * code example under `/10-error-mgmt/unwrap.rs`
* `expect` method
  * similar to unwrap but allows us to set a custom error message
  ```rust
  File::open("example.txt").expect("Unable to open file");
  ```


### 10.5 `?` Operator 
__The Purpose of the `?` Operator__ 
* the match cases for error handling can get convoluted quickly outside of textbook examples
* `?` operator lets handle this more tidy and efficiently (when we don't care about handling each error individually)
* thus, it can be used as a shorthand for an entire match statement:
  ```rust
  let mut file = File::open("example.txt")?;
  ```
