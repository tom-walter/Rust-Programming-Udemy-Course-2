## 9. Memory Management

### 9.1 Overview
* memory safety guarantees are main selling point of Rust
* memory management is done through the principles of _ownership and borrowing_
* garbage collectors are avoided in favor of explicit _variable lifetimes_
* _reference-counting_ enables variables to handle ownership and borrowing easily

### 9.2 Ownership
__What is Ownership?__
* only one variable can own a piece of memory
* a variable points to specific place in the computer's memory 
* this is a safety guarantee as only one variable can change that part of the memory
* preventing race conditions, where two functions or manipulations of a variable try to access the memory at the same time
* this determines also how variables are used, interact, and transfer ownership

__Primitive vs Complex Types__
* the size in memory of variable is usually know in advance
* when we assign one variable to another for primitive types, the data-value is copied
* for primitive types, copying is cheap 
* for structures (and complex types), the ownership of the memory is transferred (the old variable is discarded)

__Scopes, Functions, Lambda Expressions__
* by default, scopes, functions and lambda expressions take over the ownership of variables and consume them 
* unless they return their input variables
* to unpack how funcitons use variables, the concept borrowing is important

### 9.3 Borrowing
__What is Borrowing?__
* the ownership of a piece of date/memory is passed to another variable for some operation
* after this operation, the ownership is automatically reverted to the original variable
* the general indication of borrowing is given by the ampersand `&`
* the borrowing is executed by the asterics `*`, called _de-referencing_
* the borrowing has to match the mutability

__Immutable Example__
```rust
let a = 6;
let b = &a;
...
println!("{}", *b);
```

__Mutable Example__
```rust
let mut a: i32 = 6;
let b = &mut a;
...
println!("b={}", *b);
```

### 9.4 Lifetime
__What are Lifetimes?__
* determines how long variable lifes in the code
* lifetime complements the idea of ownership
  * Rust has no garbage collector meaning that variable are usually deleted once they have been used
* therefore, an operation cannot access a variable, if the variable has already been deleted
* if variables will be used for longer, a specific lifetime has to be declared for them

__Lifetimes__
* a `'static` lifetime means the variable will live as long as the program
* lifetimes can be created with pointy brackets and named with any word/letter similar to a generic type
  ```rust
  struct Oject<'lifetime> {
    field: &'lifetime str
  } 
  ```
* Rust can also do lifetime elision through the compiler

__Example__
* Rust wants to prevent the object to outlive parts of the object 
* the Person struct must life as long as the Dog struct so that the Dog never points at an invalid reference
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Dog<'l> {
    name: String,
    owner: &'l Person
}
```

### 9.5 Reference Counted Variables
__Tracking Ownership & Borrowing__
* in a larger program, variable may be borrowed multiple times across various operations
* in order to facilitate this process and keep track of it, we can use _reference-counted variables_ (rc-variable)
  ```Rust
  use std::rc::Rc;
  ...
  let var = Rc::new(...);
  ```
* an rc-variable can hold multiple references to a variable so that it can be shared in multiple places
  ```Rust
  var.clone() // creates a new pointer
  ```
* we can count the rc-variable pointers
  ```Rust
  Rc::strong_count(&var)
  ```
